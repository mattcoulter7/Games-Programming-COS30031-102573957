# Games-Programming-COS30031-102573957
This unit explored many different games programming patterns such as:
- Game State Management
- Configuration Files (Systems/Gameobjects/Prefabs)
- SDL2
- Control Mapping
- Messaging System (Publish Subscribe)
- 2D Collisions

My final project which achieved a High Distinction (90) was the development of Mini Metro using my custom developed Game Engine in C++. The Game Engine Incorporates all of the systems mentioned above.

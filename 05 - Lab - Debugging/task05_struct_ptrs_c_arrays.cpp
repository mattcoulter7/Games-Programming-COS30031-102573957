/******************************************************************************

Simple examples showing (possibly) interesting questions in code as a skill
 development and debugging tool (IDE) familiarity exercise.

Very Short Version:
 Search for #TODO marks with questions and answer them. (Create answer doc.) :)

Short Version:
 The #TODO marks are questions - answer them in order in a lab notes document. As
 you go save your changes and commit to your repo as evidence of your work.

Longer Version (recommended steps):
    1. Put this file in your repo folders and commit with a message like "No changes
       yet" or similar.
    2. Open this file in your IDE that *must* support debugging. (VS, CLion etc)
    3. Build and run this file. Make sure this works before going on.
    4. Create a lab-notes document for your answers. (Paste the questions provided
       if you want, or discover them as you go.) Save and commit.
    4. Work your way through each of the file #TODO Q. marks in order.
       - Work one section at a time. There are if (false) { ... } blocks to change to
         if (true) get the code to run.
       - Suggest committing your lab notes to your repo as you do each section (minimum).
         This will make a good history of evidence for you!
       - Suggest turning each finished section back to "false" (as it will probably
         speed up compiling time, depending on your setup.)
       - This code file may not change much as you go (simple false/true changes) so you
         may not need to commit it much (depending on what extra changes you decide to make).

There are quite a few questions (~33) but many are fairly simple. There is a simple
 text file with the questions listed if that helps you with your lab notes.

As a top level view, here are the important sections (topics) in main()
    1. Warm up. Create a particle, set values, show to screen
    2. Get a particle with the values we pass to the function
    3. Set values in a particle that we already have
    4. Use a pointer to an existing particle
    5. Array of structs
    6. Struct pointer with new and delete for memory
    7. Array of pointers to structs
